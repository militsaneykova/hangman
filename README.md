## Hangman-guess the flowers<br/>
<p>I made one player game where the player has to guess diferent flowers.</p></br>


## I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br/>


## Chalenges </br>
One of the most chalenges things for me was making the words appear the way I wanted - depending of the length and also I wanted to create undelines before actualy the word appear - for that I used div and h1, I made the h1 invisible with each letter inside.</br>

## Future updates
1. Definitly I will include leves.
2.Different categoies that the player has to guess
3.Add background - music
4.Add picture with information when the player guess the picture
5.Update the design
